## About Flux
Flux is a small and efficient PHP framework made up of reusable components for the core functionality of web and console applications.

Flux is the core of the INS framework and the INS CMS, which have been successfully used for commercial websites and e-commerce web applications by INS and cooperation partners for almost 20 years - but so far only with a closed source commercial license.
